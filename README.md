## HNG - Project 6 -- 360 Skills Evaluator
Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- Translated DB Schema into migrations.
- Create Models for tables and matching controllers.

## Ongoing

- Writing json resources to match appropriate responses required by frontend
- Writing endpoints usinf TDD.

## Todo

- **Document endpoints using OpenAPI Specifications
